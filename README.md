# Lucky-7
The game has three categories: "lower" for values 1 to 6, "7" for the value 7, and "higher" for values 8 to 13.

Each category has a chance of winning: 46.154% for both "lower" and "higher" categories, and 7.692% for the "7" category.

The user selects one of the three categories to bet on.

The program generates a random value between 1 and 13.

If the user's bet matches the generated value, they win according to the payout rules:
  If the user bet on "lower" or "higher" and their bet matches the generated value, they receive a 2x payout.
  If the user bet on "7" and the generated value is 7, they receive a 4x payout.

The payout is calculated by multiplying the user's bet amount by the respective payout multiplier.
